# Thinking in react

## Description
A simple React application designed to reinforce state management and data flow through components.

### Props
The FilterableProductTable component passes the product list to the ProductTable component as a prop.

The SearchBar component receives the filter text and in-stock filter state as props.

The ProductTable component receives filtered products as a prop and displays them accordingly.

### State
filterText keeps track of what the user types in the search bar.

inStockOnly determines whether to show only in-stock products.

These states update dynamically when the user interacts with the input field or checkbox.
